# MOFFET Language

This code is a simple implementation of LLVM. For now , this code can behave as a LEXER and as a PARSER.
Even thought this is not very advanced in its area, this still can do pretty good job at the above mentioned tasks. 
Bsic Codegen added for a few clagges and subclasses.

It is suuuper Buggy right  now, :(
But will fix it shortly 
And, yes I'll document it in the future.
